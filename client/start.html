      <h3>Welcome to the virtual chess board.</h3>
      <h6>To start playing just create a new board by pressing the START A NEW GAME button.<br/>
      The browser will take you to the newly created board. <br/>
      You can then copy the address of the board from the address bar and send it to a friend who can use it to get to the same board.<br/>
      </h6>

      <h4>This is how you play:
          <ul>
              <li>Drag and drop the pieces to move them.</li>
              <li>To remove a piece from the board simply click on it while holding the Ctrl (or the Shift) key down.</li>
              <li>To add a piece to the board - drag it in from the set in the lower right corner.</li>
          </ul>
      </h4>

      <h6>The board does not enforce any rules, just like a normal board would not.<br/>
      <!-- On the right side of the screen there is a chat box that also shows the moves on the board so far.<br/> -->
